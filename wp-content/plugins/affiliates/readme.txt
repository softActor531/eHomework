The Affiliates system provides the most powerful tools to run a successful Affiliate Marketing Program.

== Description ==

The Affiliates system allows you to run a successful Affiliate Marketing Program. It comprises a set of the most powerful growth-oriented tools.

> You will find extensive information and detailed instructions on the [Documentation](http://docs.itthinx.com/document/affiliates/) pages.

Important features include automated affiliate registration, an unlimited affiliate management section and the ability to integrate Affiliates with virtually any platform, including e-commerce, memberships, forms, lead generation and tracking and many more.

Commissions on referred users are built in, free and premium integrations with today's most popular e-commerce and other systems are available.

The Affiliates plugin provides an affiliate system for sellers, shops, distributors, blogs, membership sites, microsites for product launches and many more, who want to quickstart their affiliate program and start growing fast.

It also provides a solid framework for developers, who wish to build customized solutions based on a sound data model.

With unlimited affiliate program management tools available on the back end and a set of shortcodes to provide Affiliates information on their performance on the front end, there is everything you need to start an affiliate program.

To manage an **Affiliate Marketing** or **Partner Referral Program** and **track visits to your site** with **affiliate links**, the _Affiliates_ plugin is the most powerful free solution.

Simply put, the affiliates plugin is used to manage affiliates, create referrals and track visits to your site through affiliate links.
Referrals are stored and attributed to an affiliate, for example if clients place orders on your site and you need to credit your affiliates.
You can show your affiliates how well they perform, by embedding simple shortcodes on a page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The information provided in this section is by no means exhaustive. Please make sure to refer to the [Documentation](http://docs.itthinx.com/document/affiliates/) as your preferred source of information.

= Is there an option to create an Affiliate Area? =

You can let the tool generate an Affiliate Area for you. This will create a new page with predefined content and shortcodes. You can later customize the page and add additional pages as needed.
Go to *Affiliates > Settings > Pages* and press the *Generate* button.
You will find a new page titled _Affiliate Area_ on your site which includes a login form, affiliate registration form, information about an affiliate's performance and the affiliate's link as well as a link to log out at the end of the page.
You can edit this page and adjust it according to your preferences. 

= How can I show affiliates their affiliate link? =

Note: You can create a page and embed a shortcode manually, or you can create an Affiliate Area as outlined above.

For example, embed this shortcode on a page:

`[affiliates_url]`

This will render a link to your site with the affiliate's ID appended.

If you want to link to a certain page, you can use this shortcode:

`[affiliates_url]http://www.example.com/somepage[/affiliates_url]`

If you want to show how a link would look like, you can use the shortcode within HTML as well, for example:

`&lt;a href="[affiliates_url]"&gt;[affiliates_url]&lt;/a&gt;`

Remember to use HTML entities for `<` and `>` as shown above.

= How can I show affiliates information about their performance? =

Detailed information on this is available on the [Documentation](http://docs.itthinx.com/document/affiliates/) pages.

Note: You can create a page and embed a shortcode manually, or you can have the plugin create an Affiliate Area for you.

The number of hits on an affiliate's link can be shown with the `[affiliates_hits]` shortcode.

The number of visits on an affiliate's link can be shown with the `[affiliates_visits]` shortcode.

Your affiliates will want to know how much they will and have earned and how many referrals they have made.

Use the `[affiliates_referrals]` shortcode to show how many referrals an affiliate has made and how much the affiliate has earned.

The `[affiliates_referrals]` shortcode will show the total number of referrals that have been accepted or closed for the affiliate.

To show the number of referrals for an affiliate by status, embed it like this:

Examples:

`Accepted referrals: [affiliates_referrals status="accepted"]
Closed referrals: [affiliates_referrals status="closed"]
Pending referrals: [affiliates_referrals status="pending"]
Rejected referrals: [affiliates_referrals status="rejected"]`

If you add the `show="total"` attribute to that shortcode, it will make a list of earnings by currency:

Examples:

Total amount for paid and unpaid referrals:

`[affiliates_referrals show="total"]`

Total for unpaid referrals:

`[affiliates_referrals show="total" status="accepted"]`

Total for paid referrals:

`[affiliates_referrals show="total" status="closed"]`

Total for referrals pending approval:

`[affiliates_referrals show="total" status="pending"]`

Total for rejected referrals:

`[affiliates_referrals show="total" status="rejected"]`

= Is it possible to show content for affiliates or non-affiliates only? =

* Embed the content that you want to show to affiliates like this:

    `[affiliates_is_affiliate]
This is visible to affiliates who are logged in only.
[/affiliates_is_affiliate]`

* For content to show to non-affiliates use this:

    `[affiliates_is_not_affiliate]
You can see this if you are not logged in as an affiliate.
[/affiliates_is_not_affiliate]`

= Can we generate affiliate links for our partners? =

Yes.

Affiliate links are available for registered affiliates and they can see
them in the Affiliate Area. You can also customize these and let them
link to any page on your site.

= Can we track visits to our site through our partners' sites? =

Yes.

The Affiliates system tracks visits via affiliate links to any page on
your site. It also allows to track referred user registrations and order,
while recording related commissions through referrals and transaction data.

= Can we register commissions manually? =

Yes.

Commissions are registered manually via the Referrals section in the
Affiliates menu.

= Can we grant commissions when affiliates refer new users? =

Yes.

The built-in user registration integration allows to grant commissions
for new user sign-ups.

= Can we record referrals automatically when, for example, an order is placed? =

Yes.

The API provides the means to suggest referrals and record them.

= I am an affiliate of ACME and they provided me with an affiliate link. Is this plugin for me? =

No it isn't.

This plugin is for sites that need to manage *their* affiliates.

= Can I automatically store additional referral and transaction data? =

Yes you can do that through the plugin's API functions.

= I need to keep track of all transactions, including those that have not been initiated via an affiliate. Is this possible? =

Yes!

Referrals that are not attributable to an affiliate can be stored along with arbitrary transaction data and associated with the site owner.
There is a dedicated entry for that, called *Direct* in the affiliates list, representing the site owner.

= What about timezones? =

The plugin provides timezone-independent recording and retrieval of hits, visits and referrals.
Data is stored with reference to the server's settings and shown adjusted to the timezone settings in your WordPress site.

= How flexible is data recording and retrieval for referrals? =
