				<h1 class="style3">Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
		    <p>Some of our competitors claim to have a 100% customer   satisfaction rate. This can hardly be regarded as realistic. We can   safely agree that it is almost impossible to achieve a full score   running any kind of service. It is always possible to find a client or   two who cannot be satisfied, regardless of the excellence of the   service.</p>
			    <p>I am proud to say that our company has <strong>high customer satisfaction rate</strong>.   This is accomplished through our teams endless dedication to each and every student we help.  We will literally stand on our head to try and make every single client as satisfied as we can, to make miracles happen for last minute orders and to make every single client a return client.<br />
			      <br />
			      In the unlikely event that you are not happy with the service provided we assure you that we will do everything possible to rectify the situation, especially if we are to blame. We generally do this by issuing a   discount code for future orders and when needed we issue a partial refund (if we are to blame).</p>
			    <p>There are a few things you can do to make sure your order does not go into dispute:</p>
			    <p>1. Please provide all details necessary for completion of your paper at the time you place the order.</p>
			    <p>2.   Keep in touch. We might need clarifications   or additional information to make sure you get an A grade paper.</p>
			    <p>3.   Stay calm and considerate, even in the unlikely event you need to make a   claim or complaint. We are here to take care of any problematic   situation. Our support team works 24/7, and is always happy to assist   you.<br />
			      <br />
			      <br />
			      <strong>Our Rules:</strong><br />
<br />
			      Be advised that once you place the order you can not &quot;back out&quot;, &quot;change your mind&quot;, or ask for a refund because you don't &quot;like&quot; the product. Each assignment is done according to the official assignment outline given and is written to adhere to the course expectations.<br />
			      <br />
			      Our writers work hard and put a lot of time into your assignments.  They adhere to all the instructions given by the course and by you, and they will write the paper with the vision they see fit  according to their writing style.<br />
			      <br />
			      <strong>Not &quot;liking&quot; an assignment, or thinking it was going to be &quot;written differently&quot;, is not an excuse for a refund. <br />
			      </strong><br />
			      In the unlikely event that you are not satisfied with the product, we hold the sole rights to offer a refund to the customer in case of   slight delay in the delivery of the essay or some minor content error   since such reasons may not suffice for a complete refund. Be adviced that slight delays in delivery, or creative differences do not justify a full refund. Each situation will be dealt on a case by case basis.<br />
			      <br />
			      Should the customer feels unsatisfied with the quality of the delivered order, the customer agrees to first contact and notify eHomework.ca directly before discussing with any third party.<br />
			      <br />
			      If the customer fails to contact <strong>eHomework.ca</strong> before initiating a chargeback, it will be considered a breach of contract and qualify as fraud, a charge which we will legally pursue.<br />
			      <br />
          A client will only have grounds for a dispute if the client has not modified their assignment in any way. If they have provided all information required at the time of order and if their instructions were complete. If we the company had to compensate in any way for a lack of instructions we will not be held accountable for any marks lost due to clients lack of details and clarification.<br />
          </p>
			    <p><br />
          <strong>Refunds:</strong><br />
          <br />
          We do not provide refunds. When ordering an assignment you are taking the risk that someone else is writing your assignment for you. If you don't like it, don't agree with how it was written, or wish it was different, these are risks you are taking by not writing your own assignment.<br />
          <br />
          In the unlikely event the assignment is late due to technical difficulties, or because you ordered an assignment with a deadline that was much to short to meet, we do not provide refunds. We are very good at meeting deadlines, but if we don't meet it, that does not mean our time goes in the garbage and you get your money back. These are the risks you take.<br />
          <br />
          We do not have a grade gurantee, which means if you don't score a specific grade, that does not result in a refund.<br />
          <br />
          You will not receive a refund for lateness, but <strong>you WILL receive a refund</strong> if we fail to compelte the assignment altogether due to skill, lack of tutor/writer wanting to take on the project or any complication that prevents us from completeing the assignment.<br />
          <br />
                </p>
			    <strong>Writer Terms &amp; Conditions</strong><br />
                <br />
Minimum mark of 70% must be achieved to be paid. We do not guarantee the student a mark, but at the same time we can not just give this to someone who is not sure of their skill and work. <br />
<br />
Absolutely NO copy/paste, NO plagiarism. Assignment must be properly sourced.<br />
<br />
DO NOT START ASSIGNMENT UNTIL YOU GET THE GO-AHEAD AND CONFIRMATION. 
Reply to assignment posting if you want to do it, but do not start it. <br />
<br />
If you are caught plagiarizing, fail to give an adequate product or miss the deadline there will be financial consequences for the assigned tutor who fails to meet requirements and expectations. <br />
<br />
Should the company have to provide a refund to the student, cover the student financially for any loss or cover any legal fees you the assigned tutor/writer will be responsible for the refund and any lega and financial consequences due to plagiarism, missing deadlines or poor quality.
